# CoInSeed Investor Print Checklist
UTS: 20251211T142739Z

## 1. Core handouts for investor / Darren

- [ ] CoInSeed 2-pager (Thesis docs / PR #6) — export to clean PDF or print-friendly MD.
- [ ] CoInSeed tsunami / thesis overview (PR #7) — only if time and investor wants depth.
- [ ] CoInSeed_Investor_Email_Darren_v1.md — for Rick reference, not for Staples.
- [ ] CoInSeed_InvestorDeck_Outline_v1.md — optional working copy for Rick/Darren.
- [ ] CoInSeed_Investor_QA_v1.md — bring for Rick only, not required to hand over.

## 2. Formatting checks (Staples sanity)

- [ ] Page numbers visible on all narrative docs.
- [ ] Contact info correct: contact@InSeed.com / +1.416.414.8100 (mobile).
- [ ] No obvious TODO / "..." bullets left in investor-facing pages.
- [ ] Margins reasonable; fonts large enough for print.

## 3. Pack and order

Recommended print bundle order:

1. CoInSeed 2-pager (front of pack).
2. Short thesis / tsunami overview.
3. Any selected appendices or proof-point pages if you decide to include.
4. Internal-only support docs (email draft, deck outline, Q&A) kept separate for your own binder.

End of checklist.
