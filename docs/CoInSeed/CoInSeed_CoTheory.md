# CoInSeed CoTheory

This file links CoInSeed explicitly into the CoTheory of Evolution and the emerging CoTheory of Civilization.

## CoEvo and CoWinnian framing

- CoInSeed assumes that evolution is no longer just genetic or memetic.
- CoWinnian evolution extends Darwin with deliberate, stewarded intent.
- CoInSeed is a vehicle for shifting evolution toward:
  - trust-sourcing,
  - edge-owned guardrails,
  - and CoSteward-led governance experiments.

## Links into CoSuite

- CoCivium: civic substrate and narrative container.
- CoAgent / CoArena: operational workbench and game-like on-ramp.
- CoSteward: ops manual and BPOE rail-keeper.
- GIBindex: shared language and term index across humans and AIs.
- CoCacheGlobal / CoCivIA: long term home for emergent AI alliances.

> TODO CoRetro:
> - Cross-check this structure with GIBindex terms.
> - Ensure CoTheoryTree and CoRoots diagrams are referenced here by path.
