# CoInSeed – Investor Email Draft (Rick → Darren)

Subject: A different kind of AI investment - stewarding the rails

Hi Darren,

I wanted to share a piece of work that I think sits in a different bucket than the usual AI pitches.

I have attached the current CoInSeed 2-pager from the thesis repo. It frames what we are building as the reference stack and guardrails for a hybrid human plus AI society, rather than yet another product chasing short term AI upside.

Very short version:
- We are finishing and hardening a working ecosystem (CoCivium / CoSuite) that lets institutions run AI under edge-owned guardrails instead of opaque platforms.
- The upside is both financial and reputational. Early backers are visible as stewards of the rails society will need anyway, regardless of who wins the current AI arms race.

What I would like from you at this stage is quite specific:
- A sanity check on the thesis and positioning.
- One or two introductions to people in your network who care about their legacy, understand structural change, and have the patience and capital to steward a new category.

This is risky in the same way early work on internet protocols was risky. The main risk is timing, not that the thesis is wrong. If it fails, the people involved will still be the ones who tried to build safe rails. If it works, they will have helped define how society lives with AI.

If you are open to it, I would like to book:
- one deep dive session to walk through the 2-pager and the CoInSeed thesis materials, and
- a short follow up to decide whether there is someone you would be comfortable introducing as a potential anchor steward.

Let me know when you have time to scan the 2-pager and we can line up a call.

Thanks,
Rick
