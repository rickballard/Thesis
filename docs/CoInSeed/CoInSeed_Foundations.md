# CoInSeed Foundations

This file sketches the foundations of the CoInSeed thesis as it converges toward a fully formalized investor package.

## Problem space

- Capital is structurally misallocated toward short term extraction.
- Institutions are not built for AI era edge-control and CoStewardship.
- Civics, regulation, and investment all lag far behind technical reality.

## CoInSeed stance

- Treat CoCivium and the CoSuite as infrastructure for a hybrid society.
- Use edge-owned guardrails and CoStewardship to align AI with human thriving.
- Design governance, economics, and productization as one coherent stack.

## Default futures

- Default 1: winners-take-all, platform-owned, surveillance-first AI.
- Default 2: regulatory paralysis and stagnation.
- CoInSeed path: a third path built around distributed CoSteward alliances.

> TODO CoRetro:
> - Tighten language for academic readers.
> - Add references to luminary work already cited in Thesis repo.
