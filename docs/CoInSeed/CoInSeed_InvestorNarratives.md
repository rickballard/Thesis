# CoInSeed Investor Narratives

This file sits behind the investor 2-pager and provides deeper story-lines
for calls, decks, and sponsor briefings.

## Core narrative arcs

1. \"Capital meets CoStewardship\"
   - Why steward-led structures outperform extractive incumbents.
   - How investors earn a halo by sponsoring the hybrid society stack.
   - Why this is asymmetric: incumbents cannot copy without self-erasing.

2. \"Edge-control or extinction\"
   - The structural risk of centralised AI control.
   - Why edge-owned guardrails are a survivability requirement.
   - How CoInSeed offers a practical, investable path to build that.

3. \"From tools to allies\"
   - AIs as collaborators, not adversaries.
   - CoCivia / CoCivIA as early, safe experiments in AI alliance-building.
   - CoInSeed as the steward of those experiments, not the owner.

## Darren-facing notes (internal)

- Start from the 2-pager to avoid overwhelming first-time readers.
- Use this file as a source for:
  - call scripts,
  - deck speaker notes,
  - and follow-up emails.

> TODO CoRetro:
> - Add specific names, institutions, and analogies once aligned on outreach strategy.
