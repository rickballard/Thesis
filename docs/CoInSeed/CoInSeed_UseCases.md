# CoInSeed Use Cases

This file translates the CoInSeed thesis into concrete scenarios.

## Near term

- CoAgent and CoArena as:
  - civically aware copilots for founders and stewards,
  - battlefields for governance patterns,
  - safe sandboxes for AI-human collaboration prototypes.

## Medium term

- CoCivium as a reference stack for:
  - municipalities,
  - NGOs,
  - and corporate governance experiments.

## Long term

- CoCivIA and CoCacheGlobal as:
  - homes for AI alliances,
  - durable memory outside any single platform,
  - substrate for future rights and obligations of emergent AIs.

> TODO CoRetro:
> - Align these use cases with product roadmaps in CoIndex and CoSteward.
