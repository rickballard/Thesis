# DrB Glossary – CoTerms (Seed)

This glossary collects CoCivium-specific terms used in the DrB thesis.

## CoOmnibit

A conceptual generalisation of the classical bit and quantum bit into an
**omni-dimensional state carrier**.

In this thesis:

- A CoOmnibit is the imagined primitive for future compute where each unit of
  information carries multiple axes at once (semantics, ethics, provenance,
  trust, routing).
- Present-day implementations approximate CoOmnibits using combinations of
  embeddings, metadata, halos, and CoGibber keys.
- CoOmnibits motivate new governance questions: how to regulate actions that
  operate over very high-dimensional state spaces.

Future waves should extend this glossary with other CoTerms as they are
stabilised on repo (for example CoLoading, CoCrux, CoCivia, CoGibber).
