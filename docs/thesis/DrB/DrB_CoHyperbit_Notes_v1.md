# CoHyperbits and the DrB Thesis – Notes

UTS: 12/10/2025 22:41:53.ToUniversalTime().ToString("yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ")

Working definition:
- A CoHyperbit is a generalized bit whose state is a vector in a high
  or infinite dimensional space, covering classical, quantum, analog,
  and neuromorphic substrates.
- In CoGibber, this appears as the hyperbit primitive.

Thesis angle:
- Classical governance models implicitly assume binary or small state
  spaces for decisions and agents.
- Future AI and hardware are better modeled as CoHyperbit collections,
  where each agent's internal state lives in a very high dimensional
  manifold.
- The DrB thesis argues that constitutions and guardrails must be
  CoHyperbit aware, not just bit aware.

- Wave notes: docs/thesis/DrB/99_waves/W001_CoLoadingBoot/wave_notes.md

Open questions:
- How to express CoHyperbit level guarantees in plain language for
  regulators and citizens.
- How halos and civars might reflect mastery over CoHyperbit spaces.
